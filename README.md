# Fashion-MNIST Classification Project

## **Overview**
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify grayscale images of clothing into 10 categories using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The goal was to achieve high classification accuracy while adhering to deep learning best practices.

## **Dataset**

### **Source**
The dataset used in this project is the Fashion-MNIST dataset, available through [Keras Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist).

### **Description**
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of grayscale images of clothing items, intended as a replacement for the classic MNIST dataset. It consists of:
- 60,000 training images.
- 10,000 test images.
- Each image is 28x28 pixels, grayscale.

### **Classes**
The dataset contains 10 classes, representing different types of clothing:
1. T-shirt/top
2. Trouser
3. Pullover
4. Dress
5. Coat
6. Sandal
7. Shirt
8. Sneaker
9. Bag
10. Ankle boot

## **Results**
- **Training Accuracy:** ~92%
- **Validation Accuracy:** ~90%
- **Test Accuracy:** 90.42%
- **Test Loss:** 0.2718

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CNN architecture and the modelâ€™s ability to generalize well to unseen data.
